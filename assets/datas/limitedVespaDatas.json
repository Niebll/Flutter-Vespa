    "descripstion": "The year was 1951 and the Piaggio Squadra Corse astonished the racing world, triumphing over real off-road motorbikes in one of the hardest and most prestigious competitions - the Sei Giorni Internazionale. In the post-war period, regularity competitions were in their heyday: these were taxing trials on extremely hard routes, hundreds of kilometres long. An extraordinary test bench for man and machine. Vespa, with the model created specifically for that race and based on the Sport version, dominated to take no less than 9 individual gold medals. The Vespa “Sei Giorni” which took its name from that victory, was very similar to the standard model aesthetically, differing primarily for its larger fuel tank, more streamlined shield and larger right-side pannier housing the carburettor on the cylinder. It is one of the most valuable Vespas in the world since it was produced as a limited edition of roughly 300 units, clearly destined for regularity competitions. In 2020, Vespa Sei Giorni II edition is produced as a numbered edition and is redesigned in terms of its style and technical content, also standing out for its new distinctive colour, Grey Titanio*. Characterised by the large body made strictly in steel, perfect for moving about elegantly in the city but always ready for travel and adventure, the updated Vespa Sei Giorni adopts the most powerful engine in the history of the world's most famous and beloved scooter - the new 300 HPE engine. The style of the Vespa Sei Giorni is clearly reminiscent of the classic Vespa style but with an ultra-modern technological package. Characteristic elements are the “low headlight”, the dedicated graphics and the handlebar that, on the original Vespa Sei Giorni, stood out for the simplicity of the exposed metal tubing in line with Vespas of that period. The sporty spirit of the Vespa Sei Giorni is also highlighted by the single-seat look saddle with two-layer upholstery. Lastly, on the back of the leg shield, the “Vespa Sei Giorni II Edition” numbered plate highlights the uniqueness of this special model. Like all the large body Vespa versions, Vespa Sei Giorni II Edition provides enahnced ergonomics, spacious compartments, standard USB port, ABS anti-locking system and now adopts on the rear light set the full LED lighting technology. * The 2020 version of Vespa Sei Giorni manufactured in Vietnam and distributed in the APAC markets comes in the Matt Titanium Gray color, which is a slightly different shade of gray from the one used on the European and American version due to production reasons",
